        <h2>What is Geometry?</h2>
        <p>
            Geometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the properties and relationships of points, lines, angles, surfaces, and solids. It explores the space we live in and the shapes that fill it.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Concepts in Geometry:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vertices (Points):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Definition:</i> Vertices are the basic building blocks in geometry. They are single points in space with no size or dimensions.</li>
                    <li><i>Drawing:</i> Represented as a single dot (•). When plotting on a coordinate system, they are often denoted by (x, y, z) coordinates.</li>
                    <li><i>Mathematical Relationship:</i> No specific mathematical relationship; vertices serve as reference points in geometric calculations.</li>
                </ul>
            </li><hr>
            <li><strong>Edges (Lines):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Definition:</i> Edges are straight or curved paths connecting vertices. They have no thickness and extend infinitely in both directions.</li>
                    <li><i>Drawing:</i> Represented as a line segment between two vertices. Lines are drawn with arrows at each end to indicate their infinite nature.</li>
                    <li><i>Mathematical Relationship:</i> The distance between two points (vertices) defines the length of an edge. It can be calculated using the distance formula.</li>
                </ul>
            </li><hr>

                    <li><i>Drawing:</i> Measured in degrees (°) or radians (rad). Drawn using an arc or the angle symbol (∠) between two intersecting lines.</li>
                    <li><i>Mathematical Relationship:</i> The measure of an angle is the ratio of the length of the subtended arc to the radius in a circle (for radians).</li>
                </ul>
            </li><hr>
            <li><strong>Polygons:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Definition:</i> Polygons are closed figures with straight sides. Common examples include triangles (3 sides), squares (4 sides), and pentagons (5 sides).</li>
                    <li><i>Drawing:</i> Represented by connecting consecutive vertices with straight lines to form a closed shape.</li>
                    <li><i>Mathematical Relationship:</i> The perimeter and area of polygons can be calculated using specific formulas for each type.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><i>Definition:</i> A circle is the set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point called the center.</li>
                    <li><i>Drawing:</i> Represented by drawing a curved line (circumference) around the center point.</li>
                    <li><i>Mathematical Relationship:</i> The circumference and area of a circle can be calculated using formulas involving the radius or diameter.</li>
                </ul>
            </li><hr>
            <li><strong>Three-Dimensional Figures:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Definition:</i> Three-dimensional figures are solid shapes with three dimensions - length, width, and height.</li>
                    <li><i>Drawing:</i> Represented by combining faces to enclose a volume. Examples include cubes (with six square faces), spheres (with a curved surface), and pyramids.</li>

        <h2>2D vs. 3D Geometry:</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>2D Geometry:</strong> Involves shapes and figures that exist in two dimensions, typically on a flat surface. Examples include squares, circles, and triangles.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>3D Geometry:</strong> Extends into the third dimension, adding depth to shapes. Three-dimensional figures include cubes, spheres, and pyramids.
        </p>

        <h2>Building 3D from 2D:</h2>
        <p>
            3D shapes can be built using 2D shapes as building blocks. For example, stacking multiple 2D squares can form a 3D cube. This concept is fundamental in computer graphics, where 3D models are often constructed from 2D polygons.
        </p>

        <h2>Endless Possibilities with 3D Geometry:</h2>
        <p>
            3D geometry allows us to represent and manipulate objects in three-dimensional space, enabling the creation of realistic models for various applications, including computer-aided design (

            <h2>Why am I stressing Geometry so much?!</h2>
            <p>Geometry is the building blocks for <b><em>EVERYTHING</em></b> we will be doing in modeling.</p>
            
            <p>When it comes to 3D modeling, understanding geometry is like having a superpower. It provides you with the ability to visualize and create intricate designs, bringing your ideas to life in three-dimensional space. Here's why geometry is so valuable in the realm of 3D modeling:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Precise Shapes and Structures:</h3>
            <p>Geometry enables you to define precise shapes and structures in your 3D models. Whether you're creating architectural designs, characters, or complex machinery, a solid understanding of geometric principles allows you to craft accurate and realistic representations.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Mesh Modeling:</h3>
            <p>In Blender, one of the primary techniques for 3D modeling is mesh modeling, which involves manipulating geometric meshes to form objects. Knowing how to work with vertices, edges, and faces allows you to sculpt and shape your models with precision. Understanding concepts like topology and edge flow becomes essential for creating models that deform and animate realistically.</p>
            
            <h3>3. CAD (Computer-Aided Design):</h3>
            <p>In the field of Computer-Aided Design (CAD), which is widely used in architecture, engineering, and product design, geometry is the backbone. CAD software relies on geometric principles to create accurate representations of physical objects. Proficiency in geometry ensures that your CAD models are not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional and manufacturable.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Efficient Problem-Solving:</h3>
            <p>Geometry equips you with a powerful toolkit for problem-solving. Whether you're figuring out how to align components, calculate dimensions, or optimize the structure of your model, geometric principles provide a systematic and efficient approach to address challenges in 3D modeling.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Visualization and Planning:</h3>
            <p>Before diving into the digital realm, architects, designers, and engineers often sketch and plan their ideas on paper. These initial drawings heavily rely on geometric concepts. Understanding geometric relationships allows you to sketch, plan, and visualize your concepts more effectively, resulting in better-informed 3D models.</p>
            
            <p>So, the next time you're immersed in 3D modeling, remember that every curve, edge, and surface is a manifestation of geometric principles. Embrace the power of geometry, and watch your 3D creations come to life with precision and creativity!</p>
