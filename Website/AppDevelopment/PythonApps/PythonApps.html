        <p>Most Python apps which I have created and will create generally use GUI to showcase them to your beautiful eyes.
            It is more standard to use JavaScript for basic frontend technology. Therefore, we will be focusing
            in the beginning to showcase JavaScript for this website as it is much more standard and simple.
            That being said... Implementing python apps into html and web development can provide
            for certain features that JavaScript and other standard display technology can. So in the future
            we wil be certain to try and implement a website both ways. (Things like flask and bottle could be useful!)
        </p>

            If that doesn't satisfy your python app cravings, I apologize but won't leave you completely hanging.
            If you would like to check out some of my python applications check out my Github! 
            We will be working together to compile a useful open-source python application database.
