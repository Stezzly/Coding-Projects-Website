    <h4>Sorry to dissapoint...</h4>
    <p>Most Python apps which I have created and will create generally use GUI to showcase them to your beautiful eyes.
        It is more standard to use JavaScript for basic frontend technology. Therefore, we will be focusing
        in the beginning to showcase JavaScript for this website as it is much more standard and simple.
        That being said... Implementing python apps into html and web development can provide
        for certain features that JavaScript and other standard display technology can. So in the future
        we wil be certain to try and implement a website both ways. (Things like flask and bottle could be useful!)
    </p>
    
    <p>
        If that doesn't satisfy your python app cravings, I apologize but won't leave you completely hanging.
        If you would like to check out some of my python applications check out my Github! 
        We will be working together to compile a useful open-source python application database.

    <h3>Timer</h3>

    <p>
        We can create a plethora of applications with JavaScript. Some useful, not so very useful, stupidly simple, and extremely complex.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sticking to the basic project theme of timers to start off with like we did in python to start
        Here is a basic JavaScript timer that lets the user start, stop, and reset the timer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Referring back to simplicity of JavaScript GUI vs Python; This timer uses 30 lines of code, 
        while our python timer_with_display uses 121! As well, we have to import modules like tkinter to allow
        graphical display wheras JavaScript, all built in.
