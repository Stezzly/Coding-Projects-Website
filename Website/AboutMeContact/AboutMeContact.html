        <p>           
            As you might already know, i like to code.
            I've created this website to showcase my journey throughout the technological world.
            Software, Hardware, Logic, and everything in between, we will be trying to cover as much as we possibly while keeping it neatly organized and straightforward, and always open source.

        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
            The goal to make this a page a database, forum,
            and warm place where anyone can come to discuss thier thoughts, promote their skills, or just have fun
        <p>
            I'm always very interested to talking to like minds and getting to learn or teach wherever I can.
