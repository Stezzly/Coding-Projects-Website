    <h1>Welcome to C Programming!</h1>
    <p>This guide provides an easy-to-follow introduction to C programming, aimed at those who are new to coding. C is a powerful general-purpose
        language that forms the basis for other programming languages such as C++, Java, and C#.
        By the end of this guide, you will understand the basics of C programming, including syntax, data types, and simple input/output operations.

        <h2>Why should I use C?</h2>
        <p>C is renowned for its efficiency and control over system resources, making it an ideal choice for system-level programming. It's widely used in developing operating systems,
            embedded systems, and applications requiring high performance. The simplicity of C also provides a solid foundation for learning C++, which is an extension of C, and C#, which,
            despite its name, is more similar to Java. Both C++ and C# build on the basic syntax and principles of C but offer additional features for object-oriented and managed programming.</p>
        
        <h2>Downfalls of C</h2>
        <p>C's low-level nature means it lacks some modern conveniences found in newer languages, such as automatic memory management, which can lead to errors if not handled carefully. The language's direct access to memory and system processes allows for powerful, optimized programming but requires a thorough understanding to avoid security vulnerabilities.</p>

        
        <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
        <p>To start programming in C, you'll need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A C compiler like GCC or Clang.</li>
            <li>An IDE or a text editor like Visual Studio Code or Code::Blocks.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>C Programming Basics</h2>
        <p>In this section, we'll cover the foundational elements of C programming:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic syntax and structure of a C program.</li>
            <li>How to declare variables and data types.</li>
            <li>Writing your first "Hello, World!" program in C.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Practical Example</h2>
        <p>We'll go through a practical example where you'll write a simple C program that asks the user for their name and prints a personalized greeting.</p>

                <label><input type="checkbox" class="step-checkbox"> Done</label>
                <h3>Set Up Your Environment</h3>
                <p>The first step in C programming is setting up your development environment. There are a few ways to go about this but nowadays with built in addons to IDE's, running code is much simpler than it once was. 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Install a C compiler like GCC for Linux or <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/"></a> for Windows. Even though you will be using Visual Studio code, you will still
                             need a C compiler to compile the code. Once you have downloaded your compiler, before going to the next step ensure your compiler is properly accessible by using terminal commands.
                            Example: In windows check with <code>gcc --version</code> if you don't get back a version reply like (MinGW.org GCC-6.3.0-1) 6.3.0, then you know your compiler is not accesible.
                            Two fixes can contain resetting the computer or ensuring the compiler path is set up properly.
                        </li>     
                        
                        <li> Choose an editor that you feel comfortable with, such as Code::Blocks or Visual Studio Code. We reccommend using Visual Studio Code and then installing the
                            Code Runner extension in the extension store by Jun Han with 26.4M downloads at time of this upload. This will make life a lot easier, allowing you to simply
                            run different code languages straight from the visual studio interface.
                        </li>  
                                             
                    </ol>
                   
                  
            </div>
            <br>

            <button class="collapsible">Step 2: Write Your First Program</button>
            <div class="content">
                <label><input type="checkbox" class="step-checkbox"> Done</label>
                <h3>Write Your First Program</h3>
                <p>Open your editor and create a new file with a .c extension. Write the following code to print "Hello, World!" to the console:</p>
                <br><br>
                <pre>
                    #include <stdio.h>
                    int main() {
                        printf("Hello, World!\n");
                        return 0;
                    }
                </pre>
            </div>
            <br>

            <button class="collapsible">Step 3: Compiling and Running Your C Program</button>
            <div class="content">
                <label><input type="checkbox" class="step-checkbox"> Done</label>
                <h3>Compiling and Running Your C Program</h3>
                <p>There are two primary methods to compile and run your C program:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Using an IDE:</strong> Most IDEs like Code::Blocks or Visual Studio Code have built-in features to compile and run your program. Simply use the build and run commands provided by the IDE. This method is straightforward and recommended for beginners due to its simplicity and integration of debugging tools.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Using the Command Line:</strong> For those who prefer working directly in the terminal, follow these steps:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Navigate to the directory containing your C file using <code>cd path/to/your/file</code>.</li>
                            <li>Compile your program by typing <code>gcc yourprogram.c -o yourprogram</code>. Replace <code>yourprogram.c</code> with the name of your C file and <code>yourprogram</code> with the desired name of the executable.</li>
                            <li>Run your compiled program by typing <code>./yourprogram</code> on Unix/Linux or <code>yourprogram.exe</code> on Windows.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Comparing both methods, using an IDE can be more user-friendly, especially for beginners, as it automates several steps and includes integrated debugging features. However, learning to compile from the command line is invaluable for understanding the build process and enhancing your versatility as a programmer.</p>
            </div>
