            <p>On most Linux systems and macOS, you can install Zsh through your package manager. After installing, you can install Oh My Zsh by running the following command in your terminal:
            <pre>sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"</pre>

            #!/bin/zsh
            echo "Listing files:"
            ls -lh
            </pre>
            Save this script as <code>listfiles.zsh</code>, make it executable with <code>chmod +x listfiles.zsh</code>, and run it by typing <code>./listfiles.zsh</code>.</p>
